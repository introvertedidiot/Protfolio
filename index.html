                    Virtual Friends is a story written by three stressed university students one night at around 3 am.
                    Wanting to
                    make a story surrounding the found family trope. Virtual Friends aims to look into how relationships
                    are built
                    depending on the circumstance they are formed. Especially in this day and age in which the internet
                    has made it
                    as simple as a mouse click to speak to someone across the world. Youth across the globe are using
                    video games to
                    connect and make friendships. Even if they may never meet in person. How does this hold up to making
                    in person
                    connections? Are friendships formed through digital means stronger? Or is there even a difference?

                    Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A synopsis of the plotline starts with each character in their own separate lives, showing life
                    before they meet. Each coming across a virtual reality game called Subliminal Hiraeth, by fate they
                    all log in at the same time for a new player's event and end up in a group together. Required to
                    complete a set of quests as a form of a tutorial to the game. The story switches between them
                    interacting in the game under their avatars and in real life where they go to the same school. Their
                    lives slowly but surely get tangled together in both aspects.

                    The game that the trio plays is called Subliminal Hiraeth. It has been marketed as a way to
                    completely absorb yourself in another world. The graphics and worldbuilding had many gamers excited
                    to try. Convinced that it would be the best game of the VR age. Though after the initial hype the
                    game lost most of its popularity. Especially because of the many glitches that caused players to
                    sometimes feel the pain inflicted on their avatar.

                    Virtual Friends Expanded
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the creation of these characters a whole multiverse has expanded from this one story. Where
                    there are multiple versions of how they meet. Continuing to explore their relationships, it has
                    become a big part of their lives. Giving them a place to imagine and make up whatever they want.
                    Some of the alternate universes they have written thus far have been a royal version, a merfolk
                    version, and a future version looking at how they live after highschool.
