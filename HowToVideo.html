  hey Brenna,sense i never got the Chance to show you how todo this and I'm not sure
  how long tell we talk again. heres how you can add a video to your project from youtube
  
  the video you often copy will have the following url 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJnVt020O08&t=1s
  just swap the "watch?v=" with "embed/" and remove the "&t=1s" at the end

  and then add the following code where you want the video to show up. - theres and example in morph.html
  i've placed the project-vid style inside of content css for if you want to change it

  Thank you for everything brenna you are awesome and I hope you the best.

  tell we talk again
