                    Axel Blackwell is a tattoo covered senior, coming from a troubled and abusive household his only
                    escapes being drawing, smoking, and video games. He spends most of his time as far from his house in
                    one of the poorer areas of the city. Mental health and his wellbeing is something he actively avoids
                    acknowledging, though he never lets anyone close enough to ask about such things. In school fellow
                    students generally stay away as he is known for his temper and violent tendencies. No one is
                    entirely sure why he hasn't dropped out yet since he seems to fail classes for fun.

                    Once Axel becomes friends with Adlyn and Briar he takes the role of protective older brother.
                    Looking out for his two friends as best he can. Even though there are a lot of complicated things
                    going on in his personal life he always makes time for them.

                    When Axel found Subliminal Hiraeth he made the avatar Yae Kamisato, a hot headed kitsune that wields
                    a claymore almost as big as she is. Because of her kitsune blood she has the ability to shift into a
                    large seven tailed fox.
