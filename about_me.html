            <p>
                Hello I'm Brenna! <br>
                I am a current student of the University of Lethbridge, turning my anxiety and ADHD into daily hurdles
                and side quests in my mind to make it less daunting. I have been able to start directing my passions in
                life towards my future career. Finding a way to work and enjoy what I do which has always been my
                ultimate goal in life. Considering I can’t do nothing because just laying on the kitchen floor at one in
                the afternoon is rather boring and air conditioning doesn't pay for itself. <br>
                <br>

                Recently I have been able to consider one of my greatest achievements to be teaching a children's class
                on video game creation while still learning it at the very same time myself. Completing my personal
                summer goal of creating my own game in the process, and though it’s not groundbreaking, I am extremely
                proud of it. <br>
                <br>

                Most of my free time is spent creating fantastical worlds in the hopes of one day being able to do it as
                a professional career. Creating video game pitches in my notes app that are only heard by close friends
                and concept art that is rarely shared on my social media accounts. However, I will dawn my baggy clothes
                and start each day with a hope that it will finally be the day that I am able to get over my fears and
                make friends and connections with the strangers around me.
            </p>


            <h2>
                Artist Statement
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a child, art has been the one thing I could count on to express my feelings when I
                didn’t know how to word them. That has remained true throughout my life into adulthood, through digital
                illustrations, photography, animation, and many other mediums, I have been able to rely on art to share
                how I view the world. Whether it be the fantastically mundane or nature around me, pursuing a new media
                degree has allowed me to expand my abilities to showcase my imagination. However, I have managed to
                focus down into digital art, illustrations, concept art, and animation.
                <br>
                <br>
                As stated, to me the world is full of inspiration, most of all I love to find the colours in everyday
                life. Growing up in the Alberta foothills where the most diversity in nature’s colours would be as close
                to the mountains as possible, I have learned to appreciate every slight change of hue around me.
                Whenever I am out in nature I try to take pictures of what I see but my phone camera never quite
                captures my view of the world. That's what I hope to rectify in my art, to take inspiration from what I
                observe and translate into something anyone else could see within seconds. From the amazing colours to
                the simple composition of life as we walk through it. I feel like we all deserve to see the magic around
                us
