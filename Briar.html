                </h2>
                <p>
                    18 year old Briar Celia can really be best defined as a ray of sunshine. Spending most of his time
                    either
                    studying, baking, or figure skating. On the ice he is graceful and steady, contrasting greatly to
                    his clumsy
                    behaviour on solid ground. Even though he is quite short it is hard to miss his dyed blue hair and
                    pastel
                    aesthetic. Although Briar is quite shy and anxious he volunteers whenever he can. Most often at an
                    animal
                    shelter near his house. But he also helps tutor kids at his school since he has straight A grades.
                    Like both
                    Adlyn and Axel, Briar prefers to go out at night. He listens to music and rollerblades around his
                    quiet
                    community.

                    When Briar gets over his initial fear of Axel he becomes almost inseparable from both Axel and
                    Adlyn. Always
                    there if they need to talk or to lift up their mood. Really he just wants to be by them, since they
                    make him
                    feel safe and loved, a great contrast to how he feels at home.

                    In Subliminal Hiraeth Briar chose a different route, making the most chaotic demon bard that he
                    could imagine.
                    With a name matching his absurd personality, Achard Acapellobaratona Trebleclef Saxophona the third.
                    Achards
                    main goal is to act as violently and illegally as possible. Finding it funny how easily it is to
                    steal from NPCs
                    and set things on fire- whilst playing his recorder.
